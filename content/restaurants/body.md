    "review": "\"Always good. Great menu choices and large portion sizes which means the lunch menu is usually ideal for us. It goes without saying that the cheesecake is to die for. Finally, the servers are perfectly attentive without being invasive. On this visit something about the plate delivered to a child at a table adjacent to ours (boy, 8 to 9) upset him. The server had him calmed and cheerful in less than a minute. Pretty good touch for a 20 something young man. Servers don't just deliver food, they have to deal with all kinds of issues and problems. Hats off to this fellow.\"",

    "review": "\"We love the lava rock cooking style, as it means we get our version of a perfectly cooked steak or fish (portobello mushroom option was also available for non-meat eaters), which stays hot for an entire, leisurely meal. What a wonderful dinner. This will be our favourite spot in our regular trip to the Senior Games in St. George. May I give 6 stars?\"",
